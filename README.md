# soms Client

**THIS CLIENT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED!**
I don't feel like maintaining a client with barley anything to do & every other client ever's 20x better than this junk. Oh well, Thanks for using soms Client when it was supported!

You can still fork & create your own clients from the soms Client source code! Nothing's going away soon so go nuts!
